# Anamoly-Detection

The project aims to develop industry-specific data engineering and build advanced supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to find these anomalies in multiple contexts with complex datasets. 

# Learning objective 

1. Construct knowledge-specific features for various datasets that can capture data anomalies.
2. Critique the potential usefulness of features towards anomaly detection in complex industry problems.
3. Develop models for advanced supervised and unsupervised learning in anomaly detection.
4. Execute automated machine learning using commercial or open-source packages.
5. Recommend strategies for monitoring model performance once in production.
